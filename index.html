             <div class="post-content">
            <p>This journey start a year and half ago. When i met the one i knew
              i was going to marry one day. I was working on a pipeline In
              Wyoming, which is far from my home of Louisiana. I was just
              discovering my desire to be a programmer when i met Alysha. I
              knew that fate had brought us together. Had no idea why and i was
              not the one to believe in these type of things at all. But without
              a doubt this was true. Also i was faced with medical issuses that
              forced me to quit pipelineing in Wyoming. Not knowing if it was
              altitude or what was causing me to have terrible nose bleeds.</p>
              <p>I brought Alysha with me and we lived in Louisiana for a Year.
              After that Year Alysha and i went back to Wyoming she was going to
              visit family for a week and i was going to return to Louisiana.
              On my way home with two others to help me do the driving, this
              was a 2600 mile trip, we was pulled over and arrested after coming
              out of Colorado. One of us in the car had purchase legal Marijuana
              and brought across Texas lines. I was kept in a Texas jail for
              a month. Away from my finance and not working our funds had
              become none. With me getting released and being closer to my home
              thats where i went after my release. Since the we have been plagued
              with bad luck and seems fate has kept us apart.</p><p>I ask and pray to
              god for an answer as to why bring me together with my love and to
              hold us apart. All the while of spending money to try and keep her
              off the streets, which i have been a failure sometimes, i've been
              trying to start college as web devloper. Not an English major, as
              you can tell. My babe and me love each other and want nothing more
              but to be together, home, and happy.</p>
